These runbooks are for incident response and production operations of `RedisCluster` resources managed by this operator.

| Reconciler loop appears stuck | [Stuck Reconciler](/runbooks/stuck-reconciler) |
| All data pods lost, PVCs intact | [Total Cluster Loss](/runbooks/total-cluster-loss) |
| Single corrupted replica PVC | [PVC Corruption](/runbooks/pvc-corruption) |
| Suspected split-brain (two primaries) | [Split-Brain Recovery](/runbooks/split-brain-recovery) |

## Shared Conventions

<Warning>
  Set shell variables before executing commands:
  - `NS=<rediscluster namespace>`
  - `CLUSTER=<rediscluster name>`
</Warning>

- Prefer touching annotations to force immediate reconciliation; the controller also reconciles periodically.
- Validate the cluster has returned to `status.phase=Healthy` before closing the incident.
